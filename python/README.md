# libioplus

This is the python library to control the [Home Automation Stackable Card for Raspberry Pi](https://sequentmicrosystems.com/products/raspberry-pi-home-automation-card).

## Install

```bash
sudo pip install SMioplus
```

## Usage

Now you can import the megaio library and use its functions. To test, read relays status from the board with stack level 0:

```bash
~$ python
Python 2.7.9 (default, Sep 17 2016, 20:26:04)
[GCC 4.9.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import libioplus
>>> libioplus.getAdcV(0, 1)
2.654391
>>>
```
